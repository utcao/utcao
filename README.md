### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a bioinformatics technician. I have experience on multi-omics, involving DNA methylation (bisulfute sequence), Accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq, cut-tag), Histone modification, whole genome sequence, RNA-seq and shut-gun protein sequence based on HPLC-MS (DIA, TMT etc). click to view [my homepage](https://utcao.github.io/)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on somatic mutations.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning pytorch.

âš¡ I am interested in applying artificial intelligence to understand genetic architecture of gene regulation.
