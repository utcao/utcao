### Hi there 👋

I am a bioinformatics technician. I have experience on multi-omics, involving DNA methylation (bisulfute sequence), Accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq, cut-tag), Histone modification, whole genome sequence, RNA-seq and shut-gun protein sequence based on HPLC-MS (DIA, TMT etc). 

🔭 I’m currently working on somatic mutations.
🌱 I’m currently learning pytorch.
⚡ I am interested in applying artificial intelligence to understand genetic architecture of gene regulation.
